# Basic Value Investing Principles (adapted from 5 Rules for Successful Stock Investing)

## The Five Rules

1. Do your homework. DO NOT invest in companies you do not understand.
2. Find companies with a strong competitive advantage. These companies will tend to have more stable cash flows, growth potential and/or pricing power in their respective industries.
   - Ask yourself, "How does a company manage to keep competitors at bay and earn consistently fat profits?
3. Applying a margin of safety to the intrinsic value of the security. This typically ranges from 20–60% depending on how risky the company is or the certainty in your valuation.
4. Hold for the long term. Long term investing is far more favorable than short term investing. Over a long time horizon, your investments are less susceptible to the whims of the market and you will be taxed at a much lower rate on your capital gains.
5. Know when to sell. The four reasons to sell are: you made a mistake in your initial evaluation, the long-term fundamentals of the company have changed for the worse, you have a better investment option awaiting you and your portfolio is overly concentrated in one stock (over 10–15% in one stock).
